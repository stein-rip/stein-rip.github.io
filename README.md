I have no idea what I'm doing.

UPDATE: I now know what I'm doing!

When I created this website I was just having fun and trying to remember what I learned about web development back in the early 2000's. I knew I wanted to take a coding bootcamp, but hadn't had any real plans just yet. 

I graduated from that dream bootcamp last week and have big plans for my personal website! 
Look forward to some fun features like the implementation of a mini anti-social media and a leaderboard of losers in the government competing for guillotine face of the day!   

Always,
